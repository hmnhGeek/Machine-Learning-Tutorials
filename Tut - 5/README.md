## k - Nearest Regressor Vs. k - Nearest Classifier

Till now k - nearest classifier was implemented on various dataset. A new version of the same k - nearest algorithm is its **Regressor**.
Classifiers are good as long as you do not need to predict the continuous targets, for example, labels. But when you require to predict continuous quantities, for example, height of students in a class, then a regressor is more better choice than a classifier.

Here, I have shown a curve which displays the accuracy of the Classifier Vs Regressor on a continuous dataset of buildings heating and cooling load predictions.

Claearly it can be seen that the Regressor has higher accuracy for most of the k - neighbors.
